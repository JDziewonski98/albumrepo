# How to use

To run the backend:

Option A)
If you have IntelliJ installed, open this repo as an IntelliJ project, then simply build and run the main
in the src folder.
You can right click on the tests folder and 'run all' to run tests.

Option B)
Ensure you have Gradle installed, then run the command 'gradle bootRun' from this root directory from the terminal.


To run the frontend:

'cd' into the 'frontend' folder and follow the instructions to run it in the readme within.

# Ideas for future
A few more ideas that I could definitely implement, given more time.
- Paginate api responses
- Set up Flyway to create database migrations, and to prepopualte with some data.
- Create a login authentication system to see just your albums.
- Add ability to edit your albums.
- Add frontend feature to select multiple and delete.
- Add custom tags other than genre.
