# Shopify Backend Challenge: Music Album Repository

My submission for the Shopify backend challenge is an album repository written in Java Spring Boot.
The concept for this app is to have an interface that a music record collector could use to visually
keep track of all their albums, and be able to search based on their custom descriptions and genre tags.
You can upload albums along with cover art, genre tags, a title, artist, and description,
and then search for albums by genre (match any / match all), or by keyword. You can also delete them.
The backend code was developed keeping in mind all the best practices for Spring microservices, including design
and naming conventions, and has a pretty extensive set of unit tests written.

I also made a front end using Vue.js to interface with the backend. Since this was a backend challenge, 
I took the liberty of reusing some components from a previous project of mine for the front end, and hooking
them up to my brand new backend!
